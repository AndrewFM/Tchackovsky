Overview
============
A program made in 24 hours for Rutger's hackathon, HackRU 2013. Won the prize for "best solo hack". 
Created by Andrew Marrero.

This hack takes some basic Music Theory rules and concepts, and procedurally generates music using those concepts via markov chains and random chance. Once the music is computed, it is outputted to a text file, and used as input to GNU Lilypond. Lilypond interprets the input, creates sheet music as a PDF, and also generates a corresponding MIDI file.

Lilypond must be installed to run this program.
